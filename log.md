## Add PVS

Today on 3 july 2025 I added PVS to our chess engine. This made improvement to the over all game play of the engine.
It won against the older version as both black and white. And I expect a good elo gain. I have included comments in the code explaining the ideas. If needed i will add some explaination here too.

## Removed PVS

After repeated testing seems like there is some issue that needs to be solved before we can use PVS.

## NPS, MATE Issue, Repeating.

@tissatussa shared some games that point out that engine missed a mate and drew a game in winning position. This could be realted to PVS or TT. But we need to test it after recent changes before I can proceed.
